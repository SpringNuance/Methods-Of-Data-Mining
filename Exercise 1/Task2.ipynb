    "Learning goal: To study distance functions and metrics for set form data. Consider a social network where each user is associated with a set of labels that best describe a set of properties of the user. We define the profile of the user to be the set of associated labels, i.e., given a set $P = {p_1,...,p_n}$ of user profiles and a universe of labels $L = {l_1,...,l_m}$, each profile pi âˆˆ P is a set of labels $L_i \\subseteq L$. The task is to design functions to measure the distance between two labels and similarity between two user profiles."
