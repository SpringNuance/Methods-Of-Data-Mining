Obligatory options missing
Extra or missing command line parameters. The syntax is

kingfisher -i<inputfile> -k<max item number> -M<threshold> [-w<measure> -t<type of rules>
 -m<minfr> -c<mincf> -l<rule length> -q<#rules to print> -p<output format>
 -o<output file> -e<compatibility constraints> -b<extra constraints> -a<attr.file> -f<fixed consequences> -u -d]

-i<inputfile>
         in transaction form; each row lists attributes which have value 1 in data
-k<max item number>
         integer, >=2 (otherwise not sensible)
-w<measure>
        1=Fisher's p, 2=ln(p) (default), 3=chi2, 4=MI (mutual information)
-M<threshold for the measure>
         should be [0,1] for measure 1, <0.0 for measure 2, and >0 for measure 3
        (if the program is slow, use smaller thresholds)  
-t<type of rules>
         1=only positive rules (default), 2=only negative rules, 3=both positive and
         negative rules
[-m<minfr>]
         minimum frequency threshold, minimum value for p(XA), in [0,1]
         (default 5/n, where n is the number of rows)
[-c<mincf>]
         minimum confidence threshold, minimum value for P(A|X), in [0,1] (default 0.0) 
[-l<rule length>]
         maximum number of attributes in the rule, including consequent
         (default 50; if the program is slow, try a smaller value)
[-q<#rules to print>]
         number of best rules which are searched, should be >=0 (default 100) 
         (if the program is slow, try a smaller value)
[-p<output format>]
         1 or 2 (default 1)
         format 1 outputs X -> A fr cf lift M (X -> ~A for negative rules)
         format 2 outputs X A or X ~A (negative rules)
[-o<outputfile>]
        (default stdout)
[-e<compatibility constraints>]
         file for compatibility constraints lists on each row attributes, any two
         of which cannot occur together
[-b<extra constraints>]
         file for extra constraints lists on each row first a consequence attribute
         and then its forbidden condition attributes
[-u]
         uses an upperbound estimate for  ln(1+q1+...+q1q2...qm)
[-d]
         disables continuity correction (otherwise used with chi2)
