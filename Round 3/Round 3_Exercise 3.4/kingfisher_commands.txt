# Transform labels to numerical codes:
./namescodes -nbirdstrans.txt -tbirdtable.txt -L

The attributes and codes are listed in birdtable.txt (you can check it
to see how many attributes you have).

Run kingfisher with data birdstrans.txt.codes using a suitable threshold
(so that you find, e.g., 100-300 rules) and save results to birdrules.txt

Transform numerical codes back to label names: ./namescodes -cbirdrules.txt
-tbirdtable.txt The result is birdrules.txt.names

Look at birdrules.txt.names and analyze the rules. Hint: You can use
command egrep to pick up rules related to certain attributes, like egrep
”long-billed” birdrules.txt.names.

Note: If you generated a constraint file using labels, you need to convert
it to numerical codes, too, but you need to use the same translation table.
E.g., if the file with labels is bconstr.txt, run

$ namescodes -n bconstr.txt -tbirdtable.txt
