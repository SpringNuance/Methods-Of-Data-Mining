Program namescodes transforms transaction data containing word labels
to numerical codes (integers) and back. The numerical codes
are needed for running kingfisher and many other association mining
programs, while interpretation of patterns is easier with descriptive
labels for categorical values.


Namescodes
by W. Hämäläinen Aug 2012, translated to English Oct 2021

For transforming attribute names (labels) to code numbers and code
numbers to names. Can be used to transform transactional data with
nominal attributes to numerical codes for running association
mining programs and the resulting rules/patterns with
numerical codes back to attribute names for better interpretation.
Creates also a codetable. 

Note! Very simple implementation, efficiency is not optimized in any way.

Compilation: give command make

Syntax: For transforming attribute names to numerical codes:
namescodes -n<name data file> -t<codetable> -L 

creates a codetable (with the given file name) and a transformed data file
with suffix "codes" (e.g., data.txt becomes data.txt.codes)

For transforming numerically coded file (like rules) back to labels: 
namescodes -c<code file> -t<codetable> 

Now you have to give the same codetable, which was created
earlier. NOTE: All integers in the code file are transformed according to
the codetable (if some integer is not found in the codetable, it is
skipped). 

The resulting file has suffix "names" (e.g. rules.txt
becomes rules.txt.names).
